# Status Report for Wednesday, January 25, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
- Frontend and Backend will agree on an API contract for client requests and server responses.
- UI will develop a prototype UX that accounts for the expected use cases of the web app.
- Backend will determine the appropriate language and environment with which to design the backend.


### Progress made this week and blocks
- 

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:

---
## Individual Reports

## Aarushi Dutta

### Goals from last week
- Research on the different methods to implement backend API calls 
along with the frontend team
- Figure out best backend implementations and how to utilize a database to store
relevant information.
- Discuss the features we want to implement in this application in detail with the team

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Researched on API contract along with team
- Researched and started forming ideas/notes on implemention in Python

### Plans for next week
- Start discussing implementation details with backend team
- Figure out which data platform to use for the application

## Alex Dundarov

### Goals from last week
- Create some UI/UX mockups
- discuss with group what we want the user to be able to do
- account for stretch goal integration if we go for them
### Progress made this week and blocks
- made progress on a mockup
- thought of some ways to integrate stretch goals
- learned more about how to use figma and convert it to react
### Plans for next week
- have a ready mockup in figma
- have some sort of react base
## Gursameep Sandhu

Out due to COVID :(

## Joe Spaniac

### Goals from last week
- Start working on the API contract with the rest of the team
- Discuss/determine what frontend libraries the frontend team will be using
- Lockdown what technology the UI team will be using
- If time, start drafting up an example UI

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- I will look to research how to best implement a backend that interfaces with a frontend with HTTP
requests and stores information in another database. I will need to keep in mind the level of comfort
the backend team has with various languages.
- I will be working with both the rest of the backend team and the frontend team to determine a reasonable
API request and response contract after which both teams should be mostly independent.
- Given extra time, I may look to begin to setup the backend with whatever system we determine is best.

## Zack Shafer

### Goals from last week
- I will be starting working to get a base layer of our frontend working to begin implementing testing and our testing
infrastructure.
- I will also be working in with the whole group in the effort to clearly define the types of and shapes of API calls
our frontend will be making to our backend. I will then proceed to begin mocking up examples of those calls with Mock
Service Worker, so that we can have our front and backend groups developing in parallel until it is time to link the two
pieces

### Progress made this week and blocks
- We have our frontend base layer implemented using `create-react-app` and I added MSW as a dependency
- The group has mostly completed our API contract and I have begun mocking up some of the basic calls

### Plans for next week
- I want to have all the calls we will need mocked by next week
- We also still have some discussion relating to the API contract to do in order to clearly decide
whose responsibility is what, and what the shapes of the responses to API calls will look like. This
should be done by next week

## Gursameep Sandhu

## Joe Spaniac

### Goals from last week

### Plans for next week
- Start working on the API contract with the rest of the team

- Lockdown what technology the UI team will be using

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- None.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- None, as all work done in the past week pertained to delegating responsibilities and roles in the team,
or working on team-level documents.

### Plans for next week
- I will look to research how to best implement a backend that interfaces with a frontend with HTTP
requests and stores information in another database. I will need to keep in mind the level of comfort
the backend team has with various languages.
- I will be working with both the rest of the backend team and the frontend team to determine a reasonable
API request and response contract after which both teams should be mostly independent.
- Given extra time, I may look to begin to setup the backend with whatever system we determine is best.

## Zack Shafer

### Goals from last week
- N/A

### Progress made this week and blocks
- We got a good idea of what the project's MVP will look like down and have divided into subgroups to
focus on different aspects of the project

### Plans for next week
- I will be starting working to get a base layer of our frontend working to begin implementing testing and our testing
infrastructure.
- I will also be working in with the whole group in the effort to clearly define the types of and shapes of API calls
our frontend will be making to our backend. I will then proceed to begin mocking up examples of those calls with Mock
Service Worker, so that we can have our front and backend groups developing in parallel until it is time to link the two
pieces

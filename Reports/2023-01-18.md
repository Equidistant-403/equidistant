### Goals from last week
- None.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- None, as all work done in the past week pertained to delegating responsibilities and roles in the team,
or working on team-level documents.

### Plans for next week
- I will look to research how to best implement a backend that interfaces with a frontend with HTTP
requests and stores information in another database. I will need to keep in mind the level of comfort
the backend team has with various languages.
- I will be working with both the rest of the backend team and the frontend team to determine a reasonable
API request and response contract after which both teams should be mostly independent.
- Given extra time, I may look to begin to setup the backend with whatever system we determine is best.

### User documentation

# A high-level description.
Imagine all the times that your group wants to make plans, but cannot agree on a good place to go. Now, imagine an application that can do this for you! Here, we introduce the Equidistant web application; with Equidistant suggesting great rated places, you and your group can get over the decision fatigue of finding a common meeting place. It works by taking the commute time and what the users want to do as a main criterion to suggest great options for the whole group. Our main objective is to minimize decision fatigue and help users plan activities that are equally accessible to everyone.

# How to install & run the software.
Equidistant is a web application, so all one needs to do to access it is to visit [this link](www.thisisnotareallink.com)

# How to use the software.

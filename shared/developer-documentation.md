## Developer Documentation

# How to obtain the source code.
If your system uses multiple repositories or submodules, provide clear instructions for how to obtain all relevant sources.

# The layout of your directory structure.
What do the various directories (folders) contain, and where to find source files, tests, documentation, data files, etc.

# How to build the software.
Provide clear instructions for how to use your project’s build system to build all system components.

# How to test the software.
Provide clear instructions for how to run the system’s test cases. In some cases, the instructions may need to include information such as how to access data sources or how to interact with external systems. You may reference the user documentation (e.g., prerequisites) to avoid duplication.

# How to add new tests.
Are there any naming conventions/patterns to follow when naming test files? Is there a particular test harness to use?

# How to build a release of the software.
Describe any tasks that are not automated. For example, should a developer update a version number (in code and documentation) prior to invoking the build system? Are there any sanity checks a developer should perform after building a release?

# Status Report for Wednesday, February 1, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- UI plans to have a visual prototype developed with Figma.
- Frontend plans to mock up individual UI elements to isolate frontend from backend.
- Backend plans to be able to make requests to external APIs and have something that can run.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Backend progress was not as much as expected due to multiple members dealing with illness. Backend created 
basic abstract classes for the backend and finalized the API contract with the frontend. Responsibilities for the
backend have been divided up.

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Backend plans to be able to make basic API requests (reading and writing) and handle
HTTP requests and responses.

### Goals from last week
- Push the API contract to the repository.
- Determine an appropriate database schema.
- Create a database.
- Start writing class documentation and divide responsibilities among the backend engineers.
- Be able to receive, parse, and reply to an HTTP request.
- Be able to read and write to the database.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Pushed the API contract to the repository.
- Determined an appropriate database schema.
- Started writing class documentation and abstraction.
- Divided backend responsibilities among the backend engineers.

Note that progress this week was not as much as expected, due to a combination of a busy week and
both of the other backend engineers having dealt with illness. I was not comfortable making decisions for
the entire team and thus pushed a few things out. Everyone is back and in health (for now), so things should
continue smoothly from here.

### Plans for next week
- Determine a good database to use that works well with the backend.
- Create a database.
- Be able to make API calls to the database and make basic read and write requests.
- Start creating infrastructure for Python unit tests.

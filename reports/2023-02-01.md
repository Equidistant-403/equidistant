# Status Report for Wednesday, February 1, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- UI plans to have a visual prototype developed with Figma.
- Frontend plans to mock up individual UI elements to isolate frontend from backend.
- Backend plans to be able to make requests to external APIs and have something that can run.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Backend progress was not as much as expected due to multiple members dealing with illness. Backend created 
basic abstract classes for the backend and finalized the API contract with the frontend. Responsibilities for the
backend have been divided up.

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Backend plans to be able to make basic API requests (reading and writing) and handle
HTTP requests and responses.

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- Push the API contract to the repository.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Pushed the API contract to the repository.
- Determined an appropriate database schema.
- Started writing class documentation and abstraction.
- Divided backend responsibilities among the backend engineers.

Note that progress this week was not as much as expected, due to a combination of a busy week and
both of the other backend engineers having dealt with illness. I was not comfortable making decisions for
the entire team and thus pushed a few things out. Everyone is back and in health (for now), so things should
continue smoothly from here.

### Plans for next week
- Determine a good database to use that works well with the backend.
- Create a database.
- Be able to make API calls to the database and make basic read and write requests.
- Start creating infrastructure for Python unit tests.

## Zach Shafer

### Goals from last week
- I want to have all the calls we will need mocked by next week
- We also still have some discussion relating to the API contract to do in order to clearly decide
whose responsibility is what, and what the shapes of the responses to API calls will look like. This
should be done by next week

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Unfortunately I have been busy with other schoolwork and our PUT requests are still not mocked.
- Our API contract is finished though, so I will be able to finish that in the next few days
- I also set up ESLint for use in our frontend

### Plans for next week
- Finish the mocks
- Begin looking into CI steps (Github Actions and CircleCI)

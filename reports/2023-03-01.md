# Status Report for Wednesday, March 1, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Frontend will put in input sanitization
- All frontend tests will be written
- Backend have all API endpoints done
- Frontend and Backend both deployed
- Frontend and backend linked

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Deployment took a lot of effort
- Front and back ends are not yet linked, but are close to being linked.
- Backend is theoretically accessible and returns valid responses.
- No input sanitization or tests yet

### Plans for next week
- Link the two pieces
- Input sanitization
- Frontend tests
- Implement security upgrades - many security-side things have been ignored for
the sake of time.

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- Fix bugs in the backend so frontend can actually retrieve information from it.
- Implement the remaining endpoints.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- All endpoints except for the locations endpoint have been implemented. This endpoint
has been delegated to Aarushi.
- Together with Joe, we fleshed out several issues preventing frontend-backend communication.
In principle, the frontend can now access the backend. From my side progress appears to be
stuck behind PR approvals.

at PRs.

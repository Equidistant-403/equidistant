# Status Report for Wednesday, February 22, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week

- Frontends needs friend request logic, input sanitization, results page logic
- Frontend needs to write tests for everything

writing core logic.

### Progress made this week and blocks

- Frontend has some friend request and results page logic

### Plans for next week

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- Assist the other backend members in completing the remaining backend portions: MapAPI and HTTPServer
- Review relevant backend PRs as they come up.
- Ideally write core logic, although this depends on how the other goals go.

### Progress made this week and blocks

- Completed MapAPI, and have an initial implementation of HTTPServer via Django
- Due to life issues, vacation, and general bad backend design in retrospect, backend endpoints are still buggy,
but we do have a server that can at least be accessed by the frontend.

### Plans for next week

- Fix bugs in the backend so frontend can actually retrieve information from it.
- Implement the remaining endpoints.

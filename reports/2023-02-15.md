# Status Report for Wednesday, February 15, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
Last week week, we planned to have the following items completed:
- Frontend plans to begin writing tests for the pieces that have been built so far, as well as
to begin refactoring some of the placeholder components into nicer components that utilize libraries
- Backend should have all three primary external interaction components in a functional state
(that is, Map, HTTP, and Database) and be in a state to write core logic.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Frontend got basic versions of all major pages working, as well as a proper version for the `LandingPage`
- Frontend implemented logic to select users involved in a search query and make the search

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Frontend needs to use proper components for the `Account`, `CreateAccount`, `Login`, and `Results` pages
- Frontends needs friend request logic, input sanitization, results page logic
- Frontend needs to write tests for everything

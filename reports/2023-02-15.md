# Status Report for Wednesday, February 15, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
Last week week, we planned to have the following items completed:
- Frontend plans to begin writing tests for the pieces that have been built so far, as well as
to begin refactoring some of the placeholder components into nicer components that utilize libraries
- Backend should have all three primary external interaction components in a functional state
(that is, Map, HTTP, and Database) and be in a state to write core logic.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Frontend got basic versions of all major pages working, as well as a proper version for the `LandingPage`
- Frontend implemented logic to select users involved in a search query and make the search
- Database is complete.
- Due to apparent real-life issues, the other two components are not yet complete.

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Frontend needs to use proper components for the `Account`, `CreateAccount`, `Login`, and `Results` pages
- Frontends needs friend request logic, input sanitization, results page logic
- Frontend needs to write tests for everything
- Backend external interaction components *absolutely* need to be complete, and ideally we will also begin
writing core logic.

## Joe Spaniac

### Goals from last week
- Modify the UI design provided by Alex to get functionality required for beta release up and running (this will be most of the work)
- Start writing / helping with request tests

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Got functionality for beta release completed
- Overall, got request logic and typing segmented and figured out
- Block: What's the situation regarding friend requests? Where are they being displayed and how can users interact with them (accept / decline)
- Block: Situation regarding user-inputted location & input. Who's error checking and when is that happening?
- How are we storing users and addresses for security purposes?

### Plans for next week
- Figuring out friend request logic and UI
- Maybe switch to backend to help get things up and running there since we want each team to have standalone funtionality by 2/21

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- Finalize the Database ABC and the BitIO implementing class.
- Write some core logic code that can interact with Database objects.
- Continue to write unit tests.
- Review any relevant backend PRs as they come up.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- All of the above!
- Also wrote a Bearer class to handle authorization tokens to access sensitive data.

### Plans for next week
- Assist the other backend members in completing the remaining backend portions: MapAPI and HTTPServer
- Review relevant backend PRs as they come up.
- Ideally write core logic, although this depends on how the other goals go.

## Zack Shafer

### Goals from last week
- Begin writing tests for our frontend components
- Begin to help refactor base components into nicer looking ones,
using `material-ui` or potentially other component libraries

### Progress made this week and blocks

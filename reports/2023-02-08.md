# Status Report for Wednesday, February 8, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
Last week week, we planned to have the following items completed:
- Backend plans to be able to make basic API requests (reading and writing) and handle
HTTP requests and responses. 
- Frontend planned to have all mocks written and a basic UI written

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Frontend finished all mocks, established a CI pipeline, and wrote out a very basic, minimalist UI
- Backend created a CI pipeline to automatically test backend classes. Map, Database, and HTTP teams
continue to make progress implementing their respective backend components.

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Frontend plans to begin writing tests for the pieces that have been built so far, as well as
to begin refactoring some of the placeholder components into nicer components that utilize libraries
- Backend should have all three primary external interaction components in a functional state
(that is, Map, HTTP, and Database) and be in a state to write core logic.

## Individual Reports

## Aarushi Dutta

### Goals from last week
- Figure out a server compatible with Python
- start implementation of the http server

### Progress made this week and blocks
- started implementing the http server
- figured out how to make API calls and read and write responses 

### Plans for next week
- complete the http server implementation
- Write unit tests for the same
- Start writing core logic that would interact with the server

## Alex Dundarov

### Goals from last week
- prototyping the figma design
- start making base ui elements

### Progress made this week and blocks
- was sick
- finished vast majority of figma prototype 
- made a lot of the basic ui setups for most of the pages
- did work on updating the documentation

### Plans for next week
- getting all the ui elements ready for the beta release integration  
- start work on integrating material ui into the ui elements

## Gursameep Sandhu

### Goals from last week
- Work on the integration of map API into the backend.
- Have a working Map API ready for testing.
- Work alongside the backend team and start on the initial backend testing to make sure that the database works as intended.
- Additionally support UI and UX design if needed.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Tested and worked on integrationg mapAPI using mapquest, to make sure it works appropriately with python.
- Worked on basic freatures annf calls when it comes to the map API integration.
- Additionally took a look and reserched on the best ways in which we could integrate testing into the Backend of the application.

### Plans for next week
- Work on perfecting the API, shouldnt take too long.
- Work on the testing the backend database. 

## Joe Spaniac

### Goals from last week
- Actually create working list of expected react libraries
- Start working on the requests.js file that will handle requests to the backend
- Get some simplisitc landing page up and running

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Made progress on getting an actual request to work with the mocks!
- Made request objects and response types so that we can easily format requests correctly
- Fully refreshed React knowledge and started modifying App.tsx a bit to display and request information with state

### Plans for next week
- Modify the UI design provided by Alex to get functionality required for beta release up and running (this will be most of the work)
- Start writing / helping with request tests

## Nelson Sun

### Goals from last week
- Determine a good database to use that works well with the backend.
- Create a database.
- Be able to make API calls to the database and make basic read and write requests.
- Start creating infrastructure for Python unit tests.

### Progress made this week and blocks
- All of the above!
- Also created a CI pipeline for automated backend unit testing on every PR to main.
- Doing my best to stay on top of documentation.

### Plans for next week
- Finalize the Database ABC and the BitIO implementing class.
- Write some core logic code that can interact with Database objects.
- Continue to write unit tests.
- Review any relevant backend PRs as they come up.

## Zack Shafer

### Goals from last week
- Finish the mocks
- Begin looking into CI steps (Github Actions and CircleCI)

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Mocks are done
- CI is setup using Github Actions

### Plans for next week
- Begin writing tests for our frontend components
- Begin to help refactor base components into nicer looking ones,
using `material-ui` or potentially other component libraries

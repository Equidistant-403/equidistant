# Status Report for Wednesday, February 8, 2023

## Team Report

### Goals from last week
Last week week, we planned to have the following items completed:
- Backend plans to be able to make basic API requests (reading and writing) and handle
HTTP requests and responses. 
- Frontend planned to have all mocks written and a basic UI written

### Progress made this week and blocks
- Frontend finished all mocks, established a CI pipeline, and wrote out a very basic, minimalist UI
- Backend created a CI pipeline to automatically test backend classes. Map, Database, and HTTP teams
continue to make progress implementing their respective backend components.

### Plans for next week
By next week, we plan to have the following items completed:
- Frontend plans to begin writing tests for the pieces that have been built so far, as well as
to begin refactoring some of the placeholder components into nicer components that utilize libraries
- Backend should have all three primary external interaction components in a functional state
(that is, Map, HTTP, and Database) and be in a state to write core logic.
